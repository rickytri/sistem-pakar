  <p>Early childhood learning is an approach to development that is intended for children from birth until the age of eight
years is done through the provision of educational stimulus to assist the growth and development of the physical and
spiritual so that children have the readiness to enter further education. To assist the growth and development of
children then built an educational game. Educational game is a game that apply learning and educational material
inserts into the game. Educational game that will be developed is a game (game) to train children early age especially
those aged three to eight years to be able to read, write and count properly. This educational game called calistung
game. Educational game calistung applied into the android operating system. And for the determination of the matter
calistung presentation using a linear congruent method (LCM). Linear congruent method (LCM) is one method of
random number generator. Where the determination of the constants LCM (a, c and m) will determine whether or not
the random number obtained in the sense of obtaining random numbers as if nothing happened looping.<br>
